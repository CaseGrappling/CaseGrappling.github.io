	"content": "What is Grappling?  grappling is defined as a struggle or fight without weapons. The closest mainstream sport is wrestling. The term can apply to any combat sport that doesn\u0026rsquo;t use strikes (punches / kicks) and instead focuses on control or submissions. Grappling is most commonly used to describe Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practiced without the gi jacket ie \u0026ldquo;nogi\u0026rdquo;. For the club we chose nogi because the gi incurs cost and cleaning that stands as a barrier of entry. A normal gi costs upwards of 60 dollars and it needs to be cleaned between training sessions.     sport gi submissions     wrestling no no   Judo yes yes   Brazilian Jiu Jitsu yes yes   nogi Jiu Jitsu no yes   grappling no yes    "

An additional constraint is that Case will not let any club use the wrestling room so if we were to practice on campus we would have to purchase our own mats and put them out for practices. To avoid this hassle we are hoping to partner with a Jiu Jitsu gym in the area that would let us use their mats or give students a discount on memberships.  Update !!  Cade Lueker has partnered with Ararat Judo and Jiu Jitsu where he is an assistant Jiu Jitsu instructor and Grappling instructor. He will be teaching Grappling sundays at noon. These will be considered unofficial CWRU grappling practices and students are welcome!  when practices will be held  Ideally we\u0026rsquo;d have 3 practices a week. Two during the week and one on the weekend.  "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Why try grappling, gi or nogi? There are three main reasons that someone would train grappling\n For self defense  Because grappling doesn\u0026rsquo;t injure your training partner, only controls them or puts them in a submission hold where they can \u0026ldquo;tap out\u0026rdquo; before they experience harm or injury, you can spar at 100% preparing yourself for the intensity of a real physical conflict without harming yourself or others. Grappling exchanges are also extremely effective for fighting and in MMA wrestling / Jiu Jitsu is an integral part of training. Weight and strength will always matter in any conflict, but in grappling they can be nullified with technique to a certain degree.  the best analogy for this I have heard about / seen is that a horse when standing is stronger than any man but when Mongolian herders need to tend to their horses or control them they will trip them down to their side and once on the ground a massive horse can be controlled by a single man.     For exercise  To be a successful grappler in competition and in the practice room two things are needed to some degree (aside from technique). Luckily training can increase both of these attributes. A famous quote in fighting is that \u0026ldquo;fatigue makes cowards of us all\u0026rdquo; and grappling is no different. A hard training will stress your cardiovascular system like nothing else. Training regularly will increase your cardio and burn more calories than almost any other form of exercise.   For the group \u0026amp; social aspect  Every time I\u0026rsquo;ve traveled I make sure to stop by a Jiu Jitsu / MMA gym for a training session. It is a great way to make friends and can jump start a social group wherever you may be. In many ways you can have a grappling passport.    "

	"content": "Safety  sports, especially combat sports are hard, physically taxing, and can lead to injuries when done with  Poor instruction No supervision too much ego not enough respect for your training partners   when it comes to grappling sports in particular it is hard to learn in a vacuum. We need training partners to train (that\u0026rsquo;s why their called training partners!). This means that there must be mutual respect between training partners. We have to take care of eachother not only to advance our technical skill but to be injury free. A common misconception is that all training sessions must be as intense as possible. When I (cade) was training full time alongside members of the DDS, of which there were several world champs / world class grapplers, many of the days they would go very light. Even during live training. You have to gauge your body and some days focusing on techique and \u0026ldquo;flowing\u0026rdquo; through positions is better than having a gym war. the most common cause of injury in any sport is falling bodyweight. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu combats this by focusing mainly on ground techniques, referred to as Newaza in early judo. Here it is very hard for a person to fall onto their training partners. However, because our club will be focusing on takedowns aswell it is important that these techniques are done with the upmost of care. Additionally students without wrestling experience and who have not been approved by one of our instructors may NOT practice takedowns in live training. to summarize in order to preserve a safe gym environment we must  respect our training partners match the intensity of our training partners during live training (one person can\u0026rsquo;t be going hard if the other is trying to \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo;) execute standing techniques with the upmost of care    "

	"content": "The Club welcome to the CWRU grappling club! Goals  our main goal is that everyone who participates in the club does so safely and responsibly as with any combat sport there is a chance for injury but with grappling / wrestling / and jiu jitsu you are able to \u0026lsquo;spar\u0026rsquo; at 100% without injuring your partner. this is accomplished when both training partners understand and respect the level and intensity of the session. We want to help people develop technical skills for both  control on the ground takedown skills and feet to floor competence for real life situations learn to safely and efficiently execute submission holds   with these skills will come improved physical fitness, confidence, and hopefully a decent amount of fun.  Who is welcome  any and everyone is welcome! contrary to what most people think grappling and Brazilian jiu jitsu can be body type agnostic. And for those not looking to compete the demands of strength and athleticism are even lesser. The most important thing to bring to the table is a willingness to learn and the ability to shed your ego for the purpose of improvement. It is more chess than checkers and knowing how to move is more important than how quickly or strongly one can move, although it would be ignorant to declare that weight and strength do not matter. we want the practices and any social events affiliated with the club to be welcoming to all and free from a competitive and cliquey nature.  Creators  the club was founded by Cade Lueker with the help of Adam Kates and Skye Stone. All of the creators have some level of grappling knowledge with Cade and Adam having wrestled for Case\u0026rsquo;s varsity team. Cade wrestled through high school and into the first two years of school at Case. He trained russian CAMBO (pronounced sambo) for two years at New York Combat Sambo while wresting before moving to Nogi JiuJitsu fulltime under John Danaher for a little less than two years before college. His area of expertise in grappling would be  leg locks nogi takedowns gi jacket takedowns   Adam wrestled throughout highschool in the boston area before he wrestled for Case. He was the MVP wrestler his freshman year here at Case, winning the UAA championship at his weight. His are of expertise would be  takedowns positional control    "
