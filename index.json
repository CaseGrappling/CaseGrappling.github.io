	"content": "What is Grappling?  grappling is defined as a struggle or fight without weapons. The closest mainstream sport is wrestling. The term can apply to any combat sport that doesn\u0026rsquo;t use strikes (punches / kicks) and instead focuses on control or submissions. Grappling is most commonly used to describe Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practiced without the gi jacket ie \u0026ldquo;nogi\u0026rdquo;. For the club we chose nogi because the gi incurs cost and cleaning that stands as a barrier of entry. A normal gi costs upwards of 60 dollars and it needs to be cleaned between training sessions.     sport gi submissions     wrestling no no   Judo yes yes   Brazilian Jiu Jitsu yes yes   nogi Jiu Jitsu no yes   grappling no yes    Why try grappling, gi or nogi? There are three main reasons that someone would train grappling\n For self defense  Because grappling doesn\u0026rsquo;t injure your training partner, only controls them or puts them in a submission hold where they can \u0026ldquo;tap out\u0026rdquo; before they experience harm or injury, you can spar at 100% preparing yourself for the intensity of a real physical conflict without harming yourself or others. Grappling exchanges are also extremely effective for fighting and in MMA wrestling / Jiu Jitsu is an integral part of training. Weight and strength will always matter in any conflict, but in grappling they can be nullified with technique to a certain degree.  the best analogy for this I have heard about / seen is that a horse when standing is stronger than any man but when Mongolian herders need to tend to their horses or control them they will trip them down to their side and once on the ground a massive horse can be controlled by a single man.     For exercise  To be a successful grappler in competition and in the practice room two things are needed to some degree (aside from technique). Luckily training can increase both of these attributes. A famous quote in fighting is that \u0026ldquo;fatigue makes cowards of us all\u0026rdquo; and grappling is no different. A hard training will stress your cardiovascular system like nothing else. Training regularly will increase your cardio and burn more calories than almost any other form of exercise.   For the group \u0026amp; social aspect  Every time I\u0026rsquo;ve traveled I make sure to stop by a Jiu Jitsu / MMA gym for a training session. It is a great way to make friends and can jump start a social group wherever you may be. In many ways you can have a grappling passport.    what specifically will we teach?  We will be trying to teach to people of any level. Naturally most of the members will be beginners so a huge emphasis will be on the fundamentals. Some of the founders of the club have a strong leg lock backgrounds so we will focus on integrating leg locks from the ground up in a safe and systematic manner. Because two of the founders have strong wrestling backgrounds we will spend the beginning of classes working takedowns  class breakdown  Warm up through drills and or movement training (~10min) Working floor to feet takedowns (~10min) working ground techniques (~15min) rolling (sparring) (~15-20min)  "

	"content": "Schedule where practices will be held  With covid and meeting up being almost impossible the last year we have not been able to have a meet up with new members yet. An additional constraint is that Case will not let any club use the wrestling room so if we were to practice on campus we would have to purchase our own mats and put them out for practices. To avoid this hassle we are hoping to partner with a Jiu Jitsu gym in the area that would let us use their mats or give students a discount on memberships.  when practices will be held  Ideally we\u0026rsquo;d have 3 practices a week. Two during the week and one on the weekend.  "

	"content": "The Club welcome to the CWRU grappling club! Goals  our main goal is that everyone who participates in the club does so safely and responsibly as with any combat sport there is a chance for injury but with grappling / wrestling / and jiu jitsu you are able to \u0026lsquo;spar\u0026rsquo; at 100% without injuring your partner. this is accomplished when both training partners understand and respect the level and intensity of the session. We want to help people develop technical skills for both  control on the ground takedown skills and feet to floor competence for real life situations learn to safely and efficiently execute submission holds   with these skills will come improved physical fitness, confidence, and hopefully a decent amount of fun.  Creators  the club was founded by Cade Lueker with the help of Adam Kates and Skye Stone. All of the creators have some level of grappling knowledge with Cade and Adam having wrestled for Case\u0026rsquo;s varsity team. Cade wrestled through high school and into the first two years of school at Case. He trained russian CAMBO (pronounced sambo) for two years at New York Combat Sambo while wresting before moving to Nogi JiuJitsu fulltime under John Danaher for a little less than two years before college. His area of expertise in grappling would be  leg locks nogi takedowns gi jacket takedowns   Adam was the MVP wrestler his freshman year here at Case, winning the UAA championship at his weight.  Who is welcome  any and everyone is welcome! contrary to what most people think grappling and Brazilian jiu jitsu can be body type agnostic. And for those not looking to compete the demands of strength and athleticism are even lesser. The most important thing to bring to the table is a willingness to learn and the ability to shed your ego for the purpose of improvement. It is more chess than checkers and knowing how to move is more important than how quickly or strongly one can move, although it would be ignorant to declare that weight and strength do not matter. we want the practices and any social events affiliated with the club to be welcoming to all and free from a competitive and cliquey nature.
