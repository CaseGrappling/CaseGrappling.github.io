	"content": "The Club welcome to the CWRU grappling club! Goals  our main goal is that everyone who participates in the club does so safely and responsibly as with any combat sport there is a chance for injury but with grappling / wrestling / and jiu jitsu you are able to \u0026lsquo;spar\u0026rsquo; at 100% without injuring your partner. this is accomplished when both training partners understand and respect the level and intensity of the session. We want to help people develop technical skills for both  control on the ground takedown skills and feet to floor competence for real life situations learn to safely and efficiently execute submission holds   with these skills will come improved physical fitness, confidence, and hopefully a decent amount of fun.  Creators  the club was founded by Cade Lueker with the help of Adam Kates and Skye Stone. All of the creators have some level of grappling knowledge with Cade and Adam having wrestled for Case\u0026rsquo;s varsity team. Cade wrestled through high school and into the first two years of school at Case. He trained russian CAMBO (pronounced sambo) for two years at New York Combat Sambo while wresting before moving to Nogi JiuJitsu fulltime under John Danaher for a little less than two years before college. His area of expertise in grappling would be  leg locks nogi takedowns gi jacket takedowns   Adam was the MVP wrestler his freshman year here at Case, winning the UAA championship at his weight.  Who is welcome  any and everyone is welcome! contrary to what most people think grappling and Brazilian jiu jitsu can be body type agnostic. And for those not looking to compete the demands of strength and athleticism are even lesser. The most important thing to bring to the table is a willingness to learn and the ability to shed your ego for the purpose of improvement. It is more chess than checkers and knowing how to move is more important than how quickly or strongly one can move, although it would be ignorant to declare that weight and strength do not matter. we want the practices and any social events affiliated with the club to be welcoming to all and free from a competitive and cliquey nature.
