- *grappling* is defined as a struggle or fight without weapons. The closest mainstream sport is wrestling. The term can apply to any combat sport that doesn't use strikes (punches / kicks) and instead focuses on control or submissions. Grappling is most commonly used to describe Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practiced without the gi jacket ie "nogi".
- For the club we chose nogi because the gi incurs cost and cleaning that stands as a barrier of entry. A normal gi costs upwards of 60 dollars and it needs to be cleaned between training sessions.
